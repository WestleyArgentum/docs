Particle Shipping & Return Policies
===

### General Info

Particle will refund your purchase within 60 days if you are dissatisfied with our products. We will also refund or replace anything that arrives in a defective state at any time. However, since Particle products are prototyping tools intended for novices and experts alike, we cannot replace units that break during use outside of the specifications described in Particle documentation.

Tracking numbers for all Particle shipments will be emailed to the email address you used to place your oder.


### Shipping within the United States

We use USPS First Class Mail for ground shipping, USPS Priority Mail for expedited shipping, and UPS for overnight shipping. Please note that USPS tracking might take up to 24 hours to register after you place your order. Transit times vary, but on average USPS First Class Mail delivers in 3-5 business days and USPS Priority Mail delivers in 2-3 business days. Any order over 10 oz is required to ship via USPS Priority Mail and your shipping rates will be reflected as such.

Overnight orders must be received by 12pm PST in order to arrive at your location in the continental United States by the next day. We'll do everything in our power to deliver your Particle goodies to your eager hands as scheduled, but please note that Fedex occasionally has weather or holiday related delays that we cannot avoid.

### International Shipping

We ship all orders out of California in the US. We offer UPS International for international ground shipping and DHL Express for expedited shipping.

Shipping times for both carriers are an estimate and vary by exact destination (i.e. major city vs small town). Please be sure to include a correct phone number along with your address. Your phone number is used for purposes of fulfillment only, and will not be used for solicitation, sale, malicious exploitation, or otherwise.

You are responsible for any VAT, duties, customs charges, etc. required by your country for importing consumer goods. For information on duties and taxes for your shipment, you can use this [Duty-Tax Calculator.](http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation)

### Cancellations

If you would like to cancel your order, Particle will make every effort to do so before final shipment. However, there is no guarantee of cancellation, as we ship all orders on regular business hours, and work with third party distribution and fulfillment centers whose hours differ from our own. If you return the unopened, undamaged goods to us, we will issue a refund for the items, minus postage. If you're interested in returning Particle merchandise, please first visit us at our [Support Portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/photon/).

### Exchanges for Damaged Goods

Sometimes, bad things happen to good packages while they’re trotting across the globe. If your Particle Gear arrives damaged, we’ll be happy to send you a replacement unit that has been hand inspected by a human member of the Particle Team. Please write us at our [Support Portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/photon/) and include the following:

- A couple of photos from your phone of the damaged product and package
- Your OrderID
- Confirmation of mailing address

Once we have all that put together, we’ll get your new package on its way!

### Itemed Returned to Sender - what happened?!

Many things can happen in the delivery process, and packages can get held up for reasons beyond our control. If your package gets returned to us, we can issue a refund, or take steps to issue a new package. Before issuing a new package or refund, we must:

- Determine that the shipping address was entered correctly when the order was originally placed
- If fault lies with the Customer, we will need to charge you for extra shipping costs
- If fault lies with our fulfillment provider, Particle will issue a new shipment immediately
- Confirm via tracking information that the item(s) in question are in the process of being returned to our facility.
- Confirm that there are no additional Customs charges, fees, or burdens associated with the return of the goods to sender.

Thanks so much for your support and understanding. If you have any questions that were not answered here, please contact us at our [Support Portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/photon/).
