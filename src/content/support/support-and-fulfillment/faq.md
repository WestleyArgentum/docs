## Orders
### Q: Did I back from Kickstarter or did I place a Pre-Order?
**A:** If you don’t remember if you’ve backed us on Kickstarter or ordered through our store as a pre-order, that’s not a problem! Here are some ways to tell:
If you’ve gotten emails through Backerkit from us, you backed through Kickstarter.
If you have a got an email from hello@particle.io with an order number that starts with 101 or 102, then you’re a Pre-Orderer. 
If you can’t find emails from either of them and really don’t know how you’re getting your electron, visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know! 
We’ll help find your order.


### Q: How do I know my order was received?
**A:** When you placed your order, an order confirmation email was sent to your email address. This sometimes takes a little while to send. Be sure to check your spam folder! If you entered the wrong email address or don’t see an order confirmation email after an hour, please [contact us](/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/#form-main) with your order number, email address, and shipping address so we can look up your order status.

### Q: I want to change something in my order. Can I do that?
**A:** Unfortunately, once your order has been placed, we’re unable to change any part of the order.

If you’d like to return an order you just received, please see the section on returns below.

### Q: How do I make a return?
**A:** Please refer to our [Shipping and Returns Policy](/support/support-and-fulfillment/general-shipping-info/) for information on exchanges, returns, and refunds.

If you’re not satisfied with your Particle product, please [let us know](/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/#form-main) what could be improved!

### Q: I didn’t receive what I ordered.

**A:** If you did not receive everything you ordered, please [let us know](/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/#form-main) your order number, the items you were expecting to receive in your order, and what you actually received so we can get you sorted!

Remember, Electron and Electron-related products ship in February 2016. ;)


## Kickstarter Backers
### Q: When will I get my Electron?
**A:** Shipping will begin on February 10th! Hooray! You will receive your tracking information via an email from hello @ particle.io so keep an eye out and make sure hello @ particle.io is one of your contacts . If you do not receive any shipping/tracking information by February 23rd, then visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know. 
Sometimes things get delayed with shipping, so please be patient. If you do not receive your package by February 29th (Happy Leap Year!) then visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know. We’ll be happy to help get you your package if we can, but until then, your package is most likely on its way to your loving arms. 


### Q: What reward did I choose?
**A:** If you don’t remember what you selected in Backerkit (the site we use to manage Kickstarter rewards), check your email! You should have received a confirmation email when you finished filling out the survey. You can also check Backerkit yourself by going [here](https://www.backerkit.com/) and logging in. If you can’t find that email or are not able to log in, then visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know. Please include the email address that you used to back us so we can quickly pull up your order.


### Q: Can I change my address?
**A:** Unfortunately it’s too late to change your address. We’ve already sent a list of all the orders to our warehouse to expedite the process of getting your electrons to you as soon as possible. If you realize that your order is going to your old address, make sure mail forwarding is set up with the postal service and it should be re-directed to you. This usually adds more time to the shipping, so please be patient and wait till February 29th to email us if you haven’t received your order. 

### Q: What comes in the kits I ordered?
**A:** You can find a list of the electron kits [here](/datasheets/kits/) which have a full list of all the components that come in each of the kits.

### Q: Can I change or add to my order?
**A:** Unfortunately, it’s too late to change or add to what’s in your pledge. All rewards have been locked down and submitted to our warehouses. If you want to purchase different items, please visit our [store](https://store.particle.io/). The Electron line of products will be available for immediate shipping starting March 8th. 

### Q: I can’t find my tracking information. Help!
**A:** If you’ve received emails from us in the past verifying your address and whatnot, then your email is correct, which is great! That means your order most likely hasn’t shipped out yet.  If you do not receive any shipping/tracking information by February 23rd, then visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know.

We’ll be happy to help get you your package, but until then, your package is most likely on its way to your loving arms

### Q: When will they be available for regular delivery, not pre-order?
**A:** We’re having a big release called Electron Day, which is March 8th. The Electron line of items will be available that day for purchase, not on pre-order! Woohoo!

**A:** Since you backed us on Kickstarter, you’ve already paid for your items! If you want to give us more money for more cool stuff, you can visit our [store](https://store.particle.io/)! The Electron line of products will be available for regular shipping starting March 8th. 


### Q: I never filled out my backerkit information.
**A:** If you never filled out the backerkit information, do not worry. After all the Kickstarter and Pre-Orders have been shipped out, we will go through and email everyone who hasn’t filled out their information and you’ll be able to select what items you’d like. You can expect this email sometime in late March 2016. 

### Q: Wasn’t I supposed to get free data?
**A:** Yes! If you backed the Electron on Kickstarter you should have received an email from us on Thursday, February 11 with a promo code for your free data. If you have not received that email, visit our [support portal](https://docs.particle.io/support/support-and-fulfillment/menu-base/) and let us know. We’ll get that resent to you ASAP!
